I compiled these on the BeagleBoard under Angstrom. Byte orders may not be
correct if you cross-compile using OpenEmbedded. All of these tools are 
derived from, and accept the same options as, spidev_test in the kernel
documentation.

peek_poke: reads or writes control registers on the FPGA or ADC

P=peek, K=poke, Q=quit. Addresses are 6 bits long, data is 8 bits long. Data
may be expressed in hex, octal, or decimal. pokes.log shows the sequence of
commands I used to make the AD9862 produce a reasonable signal when I wired
the ADC's digital output to the DAC's digital input.

dump_data: reads bytes from stdin, sends them over SPI as fast as possible
           while simultaneously reading bytes over SPI & writing them to stdout

The command line option -c or --count tells dump_data to quit after
reading/writing a certain number of bytes. You should redirect stdin and
stdout when running dump_data, or at least pipe the output through hexdump.
