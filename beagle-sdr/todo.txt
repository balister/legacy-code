TO DO:

--- GNU Radio ---
Create a class, spi.control, that lets you control the FPGA and ADC from Python or C++
Add daughterboard support (see usrp/host/lib/db*)
Create spi.source and spi.sink blocks that are more flexible than spi.srcsink
Move the spi package into the gr package (it really belongs in gnuradio-core/src/lib/io)
Submit it as a patch against GNU Radio
Make it stop crashing all the time on the BeagleBoard!

--- OpenEmbedded ---
Make a BitBake recipe that will actually install gr-spi
Make a BitBake recipe to create an x11-image with gnuradio and gr-spi
Find a better way to patch the OE metadata to enable McSPI3 and McSPI4 in kernel and U-Boot
Patch the BitBake recipe for GNU Radio to demand python-numpy as a prerequisite
Make a BitBake recipe that will compile and install wxPython, so GNU Radio can have wxgui

--- FPGA ---
Un-reinvent the wheel, i.e. start with the Verilog design for the USRP and modify it to work on our board, instead of making something work on our board and then trying to make it like the USRP
Add a receive path (downmixing/filtering) 
Add daughterboard support
Change the pin configuration to the correct one for rev. 2 with a real 28-pin ribbon cable
